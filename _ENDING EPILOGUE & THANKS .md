This was another amazing learning experience for me and I came extremely close to throwing in the towel at [Objective 15](OBJECTIVE%2015%20-%20Decrypt%20the%20Naughty-Nice%20List.md).  Luckily the awesome Discord community that has sprung up around this challenge kept me going and they have my most sincere thanks for that.

This was my seventh Holiday Hack Challenge and the fifth time I successfully completed all of the objectives.
Massive Thanks to all the team at [CounterHack](https://www.counterhack.com/) and [SANS](https://www.sans.org/) for providing such amazing learning opportunities and for being part of my Christmas holidays every year!

Very special thanks to the following people on Discord who gave up some of their precious time just to keep me sane, encourage me or nudge me in the right direction whenever needed:

-	joergen
