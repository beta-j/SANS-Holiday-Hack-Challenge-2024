# NARRATIVE #

## PROLOGUE ## 
>Welcome back to the Geese Islands! Let’s help the elves pack up to return to the North Pole.
>
>With challenges solved, we’re ready to head to the North Pole!
>
>Let’s hope Santa is back already to direct operations.

## ACT I ##
>With Santa away, Wombley Cube and Alabaster Snowball have each tried to lead.  Surely they won’t mess up the naughty and nice list…
>
>This division among the elves can’t be good.  Surely it won’t get any worse.

## ACT II ##
>Wombley’s getting desparate.  Out-elved by Alabaster’s faction, he’s planning a gruesome snowball fight to take over present delivery!
>
>Both sides want to see Christmas mission fulfilled. Will either yield? Who can bring order to such chaos?

## ACT III ##
>Now Wombley's gone and gotten the Naughty-Nice list ransomwared! Santa is not pleased...
>
>Thank you dear player for bringing peace and order back to the North Pole!
