# BONUS OBJECTIVE - Finding Jason and the Docks Area #


If you visit the North Pole Monitoring Station (Southernmost tree in the DMZ of ACT II), you will see a lot of weird camera feeds.  One of which shows an avatar walking towards the picnic table on the West side.

 This gave me the idea of trying to explore the area a bit better, and sure enough, at the South-western most corner there is an opening in the fence and a sign saying “**Dock**”.  By continuing on the path, we were transported back to Frosty’s Beach where we found the **Six Geese A-Lei’ing** from [last year’s Holiday Hack Challenge](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023/blob/main/README.md).

Further down the path towards the West and right in front of Santa’s Surf Shack, I spotted a tiny package and clicked on it…and it’s **Jason**.  Once again looking somewhat worse for wear and hiding out in a remote corner of the Holiday Hack Challenge!
